# Solving Coding Problems
When asked to display to the console, you are technkcally asked to *log* a value or result to the *console* so you have your statement --> To the console, log the value ... There you have your command:

```
console.log();
```

If the question goes *Print your country of origin to the console*, you are actually asked: *To the console, log the country you belong.

The next thing is to do is to identify the data type of the given value you are to log to the console. If a bunch of letters, characters, words... then it is a string therefore, embed them in quotation marks like so: "I am a string". Else if a number ,no matter how large, do not add a space or commas (as in 12,987 or 12 987) and do not embed it in quotes but like so: 12987. If tge value is either "true or false", with a small initial letter, that value is a boolean and should not be put within quotes nor should itbe capitalized.
